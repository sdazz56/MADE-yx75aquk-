# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
## Correlation Analysis between Annual Average Temperature, Carbon Emissions and GDP per capita and Urban Population share 

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
What are the relationships between annual average surface temperature, carbon emissions per capita, GDP
per capita, and urban population share in China from 1940 to 2023?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
This project aims to investigate the relationships between economic development, urbanization, and environmental impact in China. By analyzing datasets on annual average surface temperature, carbon emissions per capita, GDP per capita, and urban population share, we seek to understand how these factors interact and influence each other over time.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->
