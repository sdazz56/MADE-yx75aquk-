# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
## Correlation Analysis between Final Energy Consumption, Net Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and Climate-related Expenditure

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
What are the relationships between final energy consumption, net greenhouse gas emissions, and climate-related expenditure in the European Union?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
This project aims to examine the connections between energy consumption, environmental impact, and financial contributions to climate-related initiatives in the European Union. By analyzing datasets on final energy consumption, net greenhouse gas emissions, and climate-related expenditure, we seek to uncover patterns and correlations that can provide insights into the EU's efforts towards sustainable development and climate mitigation.
